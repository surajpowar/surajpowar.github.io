title: "About me"

---

I am currently pursuing PhD in Mathematics specializing in computational mathematics at Clemson University, South Carolina, USA. I am a teaching assistant in the department of mathematics.

I love to explain concepts and that is why I am looking forward to blogging about maths. If I am not doing maths, I like to run, play video games and read tech. 

If you have a spacial request that I should cover using blogs, please reach out to me, and I will try my best to blog about it.
