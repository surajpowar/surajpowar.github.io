# Newton's method for numerical approximation.

Newton's method is a technique used for solving an equation which is expressed in the form of real valued function, which may not have a closed form of a solution. In order for us to use the Newton's method we need to keep in mind two things, first is that we need to know the derivative of the function and secondly we need to know is the initial guess.
